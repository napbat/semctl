# semctx coding-agent plugin

This directory is the shared plugin package. Agent-neutral components live once
at their conventional root locations:

- `skills/` contains reusable agent skills.
- `hooks/hooks.json` contains the lifecycle-hook subset supported by every
  current host.

Each coding agent keeps only the adapter material that cannot be shared:

- its required discovery manifest (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, or OMP's `package.json`);
- its marketplace metadata; and
- its host-specific lifecycle adapter, install/update commands, and configuration
  syntax.

To add another coding agent, point its marketplace at this plugin root and its
adapter at `skills/` and the shared hooks wherever its plugin format allows. OMP
instead loads `adapters/omp/index.ts`: its native events invoke `semctl hook` and
inject the returned context without duplicating retrieval policy in TypeScript.
Do not manually copy shared skills; when a host requires a projected format,
generate it from the canonical skill and verify parity in CI.

Then add the host in three registries:

1. implement the Rust `Host` adapter and append it to `hosts()` in
   `src/commands/install/mod.rs`;
2. add its command builder and optional preflight to `HOST_ADAPTERS` in
   `scripts/run_skill_evals.py`; and
3. add the host id to the skill's `evals.json`.

A host is supported only when install, status, update, and uninstall behavior
are implemented and its eval session passes. MCP-only agents should launch
`semctl mcp`; agents that support the Agent Skills layout should consume the
canonical skill directly. Host-native rules or instruction files are generated
projections, not new sources of truth.

The MCP server exposes symbolic edits as immediate, approved checkout actions.
Each action consumes the server-generated plan internally at semctl's verified
local mutation boundary; raw plans are not MCP tools. Rename, delete, body
replacement, insertion, and `undo_edit` all carry write/destructive annotations.
Keep those annotations and the canonical skill/server tool lists in sync—the
steering tests reject missing docs, phantom tools, and safety drift.
